Q4. Scenario Question

You are working on a machine learning project to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service. The dataset you have includes customer information such as age, usage patterns, subscription type, and a unique customer ID for each record.

Why would using the customer ID as a feature for predicting churn be ineffective?

a) The customer ID is a unique identifier and does not contain predictive information regarding the likelihood of churn.
b) The customer ID is not related to the underlying reasons for churn and including it may introduce noise into the predictive model.
c) Using the customer ID as a feature may raise privacy concerns and ethical considerations, as it directly identifies individuals.

Correct answer : a)
