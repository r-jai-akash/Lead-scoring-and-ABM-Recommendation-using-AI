Q5. You are a healthcare researcher aiming to identify potential subgroups of patients based on their medical records to personalize treatment plans. How could unsupervised learning be utilized to uncover distinct patient clusters with similar medical profiles, allowing for more targeted and effective healthcare interventions?


a) Unsupervised learning can segment patients into clusters based on their medical records, revealing distinct subgroups without using any predefined labels.
b) Unsupervised learning can classify patients into predefined categories based on their medical records.
c) Unsupervised learning can only be used if the dataset contains labeled patient groups.
d) Unsupervised learning is not applicable in this scenario, and supervised learning should be used instead.

Correct answer : a)


Q6. You are an e-commerce manager and want to predict whether customers are likely to make a purchase during their website visit.
