Q3. You are a financial analyst at a bank and need to detect potentially fraudulent transactions in a credit card dataset. How could unsupervised learning be applied to identify unusual transaction patterns indicative of fraud?

a) Unsupervised learning can be applied to detect fraudulent transactions by clustering normal and abnormal transaction patterns or using outlier detection methods to identify unusual transaction behavior.
b) Unsupervised learning can be applied to detect fraudulent transactions by training a supervised machine learning model on a labeled dataset of fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.
c) Unsupervised learning can NOT be applied to detect fraudulent transactions.

Correct answer : a)
